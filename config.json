      "story": "On a rainy evening, Detective Elwyn was called to Wilton Manor. Lord Edward Wilton, the owner of the manor, had been found dead in his study. The door was locked from the inside, and the key lay on the desk. The window was open, but it showed no signs of forced entry. In the adjacent room, Lady Wilton was crying, while the servants were terrified. 'Who could have done this?' Elwyn wondered as he examined the scene. A torn letter, a glass of wine, and a broken clock were the only clues."

      "story": "Elwyn discovered that the torn letter was a threat, signed with the initials 'H.C.' Trying to find out more, he spoke with the servants. The butler, Mr. Harris, seemed particularly nervous. Lady Wilton revealed that her husband had recently received several such letters but had ignored them. In a hidden corner of the study, Elwyn found a gold necklace with an engraved pendant. Lady Wilton recognized the pendant: 'This belongs to Miss Clara, our stepdaughter.' Clara, known for her frequent conflicts with Lord Wilton, seemed an obvious suspect."

      "story": "Clara was found in a guest room, crying. 'I had nothing to do with my stepfather's death.â€™ she said. 'My pendant went missing a few days ago.' Meanwhile, Elwyn noticed that the broken clock in the study had stopped at exactly 10:15. Mr. Harris stated that at that hour, Clara was in her room, but no one could confirm it. Elwyn began to suspect that someone inside the house might have staged the crime. Checking the alibis, he discovered that Mr. Harris had been absent for an hour on the night of the murder, claiming he was preparing tea for Lady Wilton."

      "story": "As Elwyn delved deeper, he found a hidden note in the broken clock. The note revealed that Lord Wilton had uncovered fraud committed by Mr. Harris, who feared exposure. Harris admitted to killing Lord Wilton to silence him. He had staged the crime scene by locking the door and throwing the key onto the desk through the open window. However, Elwyn felt something was still missing. Clara's innocence was proven, but the threat letters signed 'H.C.' remained a mystery. Elwyn questioned Lady Wilton again, and she reluctantly confessed that 'H.C.' stood for Harold Chambers, an old family friend who had been blackmailing her over a past affair."

      "story": "With the mystery of the letters solved, Elwyn turned his attention to Harold Chambers. Chambers admitted to sending the letters but denied any involvement in the murder. His alibi checked out, leaving Elwyn to tie up the final loose end. Returning to the scene, Elwyn realized that the wine glass had fingerprints not matching any of the household members. Tracing the glass, he found that it belonged to a local wine merchant, who recalled delivering it personally to Mr. Harris. Confronting Harris again, Elwyn pressured him to reveal his true accomplice. Under duress, Harris confessed that he had manipulated by Chambers, who orchestrated the fraud and the murder to eliminate Lord and claim a debt. With Harris and Chambers both arrested, Lady Wilton and Clara could finally begin to heal. Detective Elwyn had solved yet another complex case, proving even the most intricate mysteries could be unraveled with persistence and keen observation."
